# PureMSound
PureMSound is currently developed to be an FX app/library <br>
for real time audio proscessing.

## For whos is is?
The goal is to be used from musical instrument players <br>
as a digital 'pedal board' or for musicians that want to add <br>
effects to their tracks.

## Content
The effects are purely made from twicking the input signal<br>
with the help of pyaudio library,scipy and numpy. Also<br>
the user can interact with the app through a modern GUI <br>
made with kivy library.

The project is on going so in the future more<br>
effects will be made and input latency issues will<br>
be resolved.
